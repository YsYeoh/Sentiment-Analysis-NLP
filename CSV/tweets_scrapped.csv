5,anger,"@nikkidoescrypto @Jen3sus @Maggie_Klaus @BernieSanders Exactly. And what does Bernie suggest for those who aren't even in college yet? Should all college be free including private schools?! If you're magically making debt disappear for anyone w a college loan - private or state, how do you justify asking anyone to pay moving forward?"
6,anger,@ClaudiaC @GaryEvangelist I’m a boomer and never once has that phrase been said by any I know. I worked while in college and before. Nothing was free. Ever. We were taught to value ourselves and hard work.
